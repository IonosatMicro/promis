# promis-deploy
IonosatMicro PROMIS system deployment scripts and utilities

## Usage
Navigate to the source directory and type `vagrant up`. It just works â„¢.

### tl;dr How do I test it quickly pls?
```BASH
echo "development_setup: on" > conf/conf.yml
vagrant up
```

### Useful scripts

`./sql_access`

Runs a Postgres container that connects to the database and drops into the Postgres prompt. Can accept pipes and redirections to take SQL input. Must be run on a docker host obviously.

`./backend_shell`

Runs the Django shell in the backend container.

`./backend_bash`

Runs BASH in the backend container.

`./backend_command <command>`

Runs the Django command `<command>` in the backend container.

`./backend_test`

Runs tests inside the backend container.

`./integration_test`

Runs API and UI tests on the host machine (inside test container in future).

### How to insert test data?

`./backend_command loaddata --format json - < test/data/test_set.json`

This does the job.

## Notes for development
### Can't run docker
Check that your user is in the `docker` group. Alternatively force operation in VM (see below).

### Synced folders and links
Synced folders and links persist through `vagrant down`/`vagrant up` even if you changed the config. Stop the container and remove it by docker's own means or use `vagrant destroy <container-name` to make sure you have new settings in effect if you are debugging. This also applies to inhouse containers being rebuilt because the id changes in process.

### Building containers
If you set the `build` option instead of `image` for a container, it will be built by vagrant itself. However, vagrant shall not automatically rebuild after the first build. To cause it to do so do `vagrant reload`.

### Edit stuff inside the container
Setting `code_reload` option (enabled automatically with `development_setup`) syncs major code directories of the git repository directly to the container allowing Django/Node.js to reload things on the fly. Note that you need to reload the container after changing this setting, because it's implemented as a shared folder.

### Default password
On non-Linux machines vagrant would spin a `boot2docker` virtual machine. The default password is `tcuser`. Access the machine either through VirtualBox native means or do `vagrant global-status`, find the id of the running virtualbox machine corresponding to the docker host and do `vagrant ssh <id>`.

### Folder sync
If a host VM is requested/required, folders are synced through virtualbox filesystem module. It is supposed to be slow, at least on OSX. In production environment this slowdown is not applicable due to folders being shared directly via docker.

### Ports for a VM
If run under a VM, the port mapping in case ports specified are lower than 1000 is as follows:
  - Web to 9080
  - API (if different) to 9081

### Force operation in a VM
Set `force_host_vm` to `true` or `on` in `conf/conf.yml`.

### Pre 1.8 vagrant
There might be parallel build issues if you are using old vagrant. Try `vagrant up --no-parallel`, but really upgrade. 1.7 is quite buggy.

### Configuration options
Copy `conf/defaults.yml` as `conf/conf.yml` and edit the values. You can only leave the options you want to override, the rest will be taken from defaults. You can reference `conf.var_name` in `containers.yml`.

### Custom nginx sites
Put your `*.conf` files in `nginx/`. They will not be picked up by Git because of `.gitignore`.

### Where to put SSL certificates
Everything that goes in `ssl/` folder is mapped to `/etc/ssl.d/` on the nginx container.

### Easy development setup
Override `development_setup` to `on` in `conf.yml`, it will turn SSL off, route hostnames to localhost and prefer local checkouts to git. The services will start as follows:
  - <http://localhost:8081> for Web
  - <http://localhost:8083> for API

### Generate a self-signed certificate/key pair for non-production SSL
[Use this snippet for example](http://www.codegists.com/snippet/shell/gencsr_nickgravel_shell). Run as `./genscr <hostname>`, then `<hostname>.csr` will be your certificate ad `<hostname>.key` will be your private key. Put them to `ssl/` and `conf.yml`.

### Access the DB directly
Override `expose_db` to `on` in `conf.yml`, which gives you access to the Postgres at `localhost:5432` (by default). This option is enabled automatically with `development_setup`.

## Profiling queries

Profiling is enabled automatically when `django_debug` is set in the config. The resulting profiles will be collected in the `sync/profiling` folder stating the path to the query and the total time it took. The files are saved in `cProfile`/`pstats` format and can be parsed as:

```BASH
$ python3 -m pstat profile_file.prof
% help
% stats
```

The `.prof` files can be also visualized by [SnakeViz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/). Just make sure it's Python3. Alternatively it's possible to convert the profiles to format acceptable for [KCacheGrind/QCacheGrind](https://kcachegrind.github.io/html/Home.html):

```BASH
$ pip3 install pyprof2calltree
$ for i in sync/profiling/*.prof; do pyprof2calltree -i $i -o callgrind.$i.txt; done
```

**Don't** enable `--kcachegrind` in `runpromis.sh`, it has an older version of the converter and seems to have a slight unit mixup.
