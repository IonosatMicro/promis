# promis-deploy
IonosatMicro PROMIS system deployment scripts and utilities

## Usage
Navigate to the source directory and type `vagrant up`. It just works â„¢.

## Notes for development
### Synced folders and links
Synced folders and links persist through `vagrant down`/`vagrant up` even if you changed the config. Stop the container and remove it by docker's own means to make sure you have new settings in effect if you are debugging.

### Building containers
If you set the `build` option instead of `image` for a container, it will be built by vagrant itself. However, vagrant shall not automatically rebuild after the first build. To cause it to do so do `vagrant reload`.

### Default password
On non-Linux machines vagrant would spin a `boot2docker` virtual machine. It might ask you for credentials while syncing. The default password is `tcuser`.

### Pre 1.8 vagrant
There might be parallel build issues if you are using old vagrant. Try `vagrant up --no-parallel`, but really upgrade. 1.7 is quite buggy.
